This is what to do with mods 

Make a folder on your desktop then change your game directory 
in the forge area ask me if you need


optifine is optional but not required 
to install optifine go to your mods folder 
(%appdata% .minecraft Roaming mods) 
and drop optifine in there it wont come up but you will have it
